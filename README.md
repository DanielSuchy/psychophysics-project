# This repo contains the code and the results of my psychophysics project

These files are included:
 * the psychopy builder file (sentPlausibility.psyexp)
 * the compiled code (sentPlausibility.py)
 * the stimuli file (stimuliFiltered.xlsx) - filtered means that it is a simplified version of the original real-world experiment
 * the analysis file - analysis.py
 * the data gathered from participants in "data/"
